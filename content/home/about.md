# Biography

I am a research scientist at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, Washington where I do work on natural language processing.  Prior to this, I was a researcher at the Institute for Natural Language Processing (IMS) at the University of Stuttgart in Germany, where I received my PhD in October 2018. Prior to this, I received my B.A. from the Unviersity of Rochester in upstate New York. 

A recent talk about some of PhD work can be found here (versions of which have been presented at the University of Edinburgh, IBM Research Zurich, [the Allen Institute for AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP6N2hGC8Ys&t=478s), Microsoft Research Cambridge, SRI International, Salesforce Research and the French Institute for Research in Computer Science (INRIA) in Paris).
